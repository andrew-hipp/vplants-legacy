/* ======================================== Last updated 2006 April 
   www.vplants.org CSS by Patrick Leacock, The Field Museum, Chicago, Illinois.

   CSS for Internet Explorer Windows only versions 5.x, 6.x, and 7
   !! Internet Explorer MAC does not read conditional comments so does not see this CSS file.
	 
   The following hacks, fixes, and work-arounds are all explained more fully on other Web sites, some noted below.

   The HTML must have a correct DOCTYPE etc. so that Internet Explorer processes the page in standard or strict mode rather than quirks mode. 

   Then this page is linked by this conditional comment in <head> of <html>. This comment is placed AFTER the MAIN CSS link (for all browsers) and BEFORE the PRINT CSS link.

<!--  css for IE browsers 7.1 and below are handled in separate file -->
<!--[if lte IE 7.1]>
<link href="../css/iewin_lte_71.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all" />
<![endif]-->

   For IE lt 7 -- The universal selector "* html" 
   targets only IE (versions 5.x and 6.x, Win and Mac).

/* Load the Windows IE-only behavior file that adds :hover capability.

	margin-right: 305px; /* right column width plus gutter */

	}

#headform p { /* IE 5 6 7 seems to already have padding between the input boxes (inside the p's) */
	padding: 0;

elements needing a clear fix to enclose floats 

See the MAIN CSS file for the first part of this hack. This second part of the hack is for IE browsers that do not support generated content (:before and :after pseudo-elements).
	
	Clearing a float container without source markup.
	With Holly Hack for IE by Big John and Holly Bergevin.
	See www.positioniseverything.net/easyclearing.html
	Originally developed by Tony Aslett of www.csscreator.com
	
	"display: inline-block;" is seen by all browsers, but needed for IE-Mac. This IE5Mac workaround, by Alex Robinson, www.fu2k.org/alex/css/cssjunk/FloatInlineBlock.html has replaced the use of inline-table (previous IE5Mac workaround by Mark Hadley and Matt Keogh). And inline-block also triggers "haslayout" for IE 7 (negating the need for zoom:1; or some other hack), then display: block; corrects the DIV display without turning off haslayout. See www.tanfa.co.uk/archives/show.asp?var=300 (2006 February 02).

	Instead of adding class="clearfix" in the HTML to the affected DIVs,
	I am targeting those elements directly in the CSS where needed by their ID #name.

	The Tan Hack "* html" targets only IE (versions 5.x and 6.x, Windows and Mac).
	The Holly Hack "{height: 1%;}" is aimed at IE6-win (it's within code hidden from IE-mac).
	Then "{display: block;}" (also hidden from IE-mac) replaces inline-block for non-IE-Mac browsers.
