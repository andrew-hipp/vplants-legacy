The species used to occur on beaches and foredunes, but all populations in the Chicago Region in these habitats have been wiped out. The species requires open, loose sands, which are exceedingly more rare in current times due to recreational uses and land development. Efforts to stabilize dunes have put additional pressure on the species because it decreases habitat availability. Additional problems have arisen with influx of invading exotic species, grazing of plants by deer, rabbits and insect larvae, and trampling by humans. The coat of white hairs on the plant is adaptive to the harsh, exposed environment. The silky white covering helps reflect sun rays to keep the plant temperature lower and consequently decrease water loss.","native","One of a few species that only grow in the Great Lakes region, <i>Cirsium pitcheri</i> occurs on the sand beaches and dunes of Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, and at two localities along Lake Superior.  The closest relative of this unique thistle is thought to be <i>C. canescens</i>, which occurs in the sand hills of the Great Plains (Loveless and Hamrick 1988). It is believed that <i>C. pitcheri</i> evolved after the retreat of the Wisconsin ice sheet about 10,000-12,000 years ago (Johnson and Iltis 1963, Loveless and Hamrick 1988, Mickelson et al. 1983). The plant requires from 5 - 8 years of growth to achieve its minimum flowering size.  The stem and flowering branches are produced only once since the plant dies after flowering (monocarpic). The flowers are visited by numerous insect pollinators.  The seeds are either wind dispersed as individual achenes, or entire heads remain attached and are buried as the parent plant dies and falls over. Seed dispersal is usually clustered within five meters of the parent plant (Keddy and Keddy 1984, Loveless and Hamrick 1988). Due to human impact on the dune environment in our area, this species has suffered great habitat fragmentation, which leads to reproductive isolation. The species was extirpated (extinct) in Illinois in the early 1900’s. In 1991, several groups, including the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, The Morton Arboretum, and the Chicago Botanic Garden, started work to reintroduce the species in Illinois at the Illinois Beach State Park. <i>Cirsium pitcheri</i> still exists in scattered natural populations throughout the dunes in Indiana (at both the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore and the Indiana Dunes State Park).  The plants are monitored and managed in attempts to continue the existence of viable populations in the area.  This species is listed as Threatened under the Federal Endangered Species Act.","","","","","","","<i>Cirsium</i> comes from both the Greek words <i>kirsion</i>, meaning a kind of thistle, and <i>cirsos</i>, meaning ""swollen vein"" for which thistles were once thought a remedy. <i>Pitcheri</i> is named after Dr. Zina Pitcher who discovered the plant along Lake Superior around 1826-1828.","","","","","","","","http://www.centerforplantconservation.org/ASP/CPC_ViewProfile.asp?CPCNum=962","Plant Profile at Center for Plant Conservation","http://web4.msue.msu.edu/mnfi/data/rareplants.cfm?el=PDAST2E2A0","Profile from Michigan Natural Features Inventory","http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/org/land/er/factsheets/plants/thistle.htm","Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Johnson, M.
